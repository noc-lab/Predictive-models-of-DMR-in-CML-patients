# Predictive-models-of-DMR-in-CML-patients




This repository contains the models of the models we developed in our paper,  Predictive models of deep molecular response to imatinib treatment in chronic myeloid leukemia patients.

We provide an example for using our models. In this example, you are asked to enter a subject's data, and our models will predict the probability of achievement to Deep Molecular Response (DMR).

To use this example, please go to the folder named "CML_example". Then download the folder associated with the model you are interested in. Please run the jupyter notebook file "run_example.ipynb". Then you are asked to enter a subject's data, and the predicted probability of DMR achievement will be shown.
