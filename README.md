# Predictive-models-of-DMR-in-CML-patients




This repository contains the modules of the models we developed in our paper,  "Prediction of deep molecular response in chronic myeloid leukemia using supervised machine learning models".

We provide an example for using our models. In this example, you are asked to enter a subject's data, and our models will predict the probability of achievement to Deep Molecular Response (DMR).

To use this example, please go to the folder named "CML_example". Download the folder associated with the model you are interested in. Please run the jupyter notebook file "run_example.ipynb", and you will be asked to enter a subject's data. Then the predicted probability of DMR achievement will be shown.
