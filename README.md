# Predictive-models-of-DMR-in-CML-patients



In this repository, our models developed in the paper,  "Prediction of deep molecular response in chronic myeloid leukemia using supervised machine learning models" are provided as on-line modules. 

To use the modules, please go to the folder named "CML_example". Download the folder associated with the model you are interested in. Run the jupyter notebook file "run_example.ipynb", and you will be asked to enter a subject's data. Finally, the predicted probability of DMR achievement calculated by the models will be shown.
